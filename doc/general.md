# General

Dashbird is free open source Social Network written in PHP and Javascript.


# Goals

- Dashbird should be always free and open source.
- All data are hosted on the server people joined on.
- It should be easy installable even on a Webspace with limited rights (or at least there should be one version availabe that supports such systems).
- The client does most of the work to relieve the servers.
- A future atempt is to create a distributed social network and therefor every fork should follow the dashbird api (still in development).
- Privacy as much as possible. People can create private posts and never have to be afraid that some of the data are delivered to third party services or at least it must be visible which data are shared with other services.
